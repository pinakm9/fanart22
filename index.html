        <p>Whenever I see Prashant, he has a smile on his face. Kinda reminds me of sunshine on a cold day. And so does this song, not just to me but to quite a few other people according to the YT comments section.

        <p>Akhil's so handsome I almost have a mancrush on him #nohomo. Yes, this song is called Plastic Love and yes #stillnohomo.

        <p>I've seen Arnab read a lot of books, a lot of them without physics or maths. This song is based on a sci-fi short story by Ray Bradbury called The Veldt. It's kinda ghastly but I think Arnab would like it if he read it unless he already does.

            <p>Once upon a time Manisha gave me some really amazing advice. I didn't act on it mostly because I'm a dumbfuck. I fucked it up royally. Thanks for being so nice to me. You get a song made on a marble machine.

            <p>My hands hurt from coding. I wish I had a more macho excuse for the pain, like I punched through a wall or something. I bet Joydeep has a macho excuse. I wanted to end with a meme song. Sorry.
